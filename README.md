Hi, and welcome to this incredible journey with Programming. I am a recent graduate, holding a Bachelor's 
with Honours in Mechatronics Engineering, and yearn to develop and improve my passion for solving problems with programming. I am a learned C/C++ ,
Java/Matlab Programmer, and a self-taught web Developer. Programming is a rich,
and wonderful tool to help us solve problems which takes humans years to muster. Luckily for us, we have computers.
I hope you find something in my code that will help you. I am still learning so I will improve on the current code uploaded.
Luckily, with Github, we have an amazing platform encouraging us to learn more and develop as we indulge in this experience and plethora
of knowledge. If, by any chance, you want to submit a query, you can reach me at: wikusvandermerwe@rocketmail,com

I wish you luck,

Wikus Van Der Merwe
